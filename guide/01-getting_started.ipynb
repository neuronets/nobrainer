It implements several 3D convolutional models from recent literature, methods for loading and augmenting volumetric data than can be used with any TensorFlow or Keras model, losses and metrics for 3D data, and utilities for model training, evaluation, prediction, and transfer learning.\n",

For this reason, please run one notebook at a time, and keep an eye on the resources used.\n",

To use a different runtime, please select `Runtime > Change runtime type` in the menu bar. Then, choose either `GPU` or `TPU` under `Hardware accelerator`. No code changes are required when running on CPU or GPU runtime. When using the TPU runtime, however, special care must be taken for things to work properly. Please refer to the TPU guide notebook in this directory for more information.\n",
